# Covid-19-Data-Exploration-With-SQL

For this project, I used SQL to delve into COVID-19 data and uncover insights that would help us understand the pandemic better. SQL is a programming language that enables us to manage and manipulate data stored in relational database management systems (RDBMS). This project involved creating tables, inserting data, and writing queries to extract information from the COVID-19 data.

To craft effective queries, I made use of several SQL features, including aggregate functions, joins, and subqueries. Aggregate functions allowed us to perform calculations on multiple rows of data and obtain a single result. Joins let us merge data from different tables, and subqueries enabled us to embed one query inside another to form more complex queries.

Throughout this project, I demonstrated my expertise in using SQL to work with data and extract insights from it. Our analysis should be useful to anyone seeking to comprehend the COVID-19 situation.
